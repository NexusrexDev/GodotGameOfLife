# The Game Of Life on Godot
This is a basic implementation of Conway's *Game of Life* using Godot Engine 3.5.
I had worked on this project for a short amount of time, about an hour and a half.

This quick project was quite the fun challenge to tackle tileset management in runtime and fiddle around with post-processing in 2D.

The game is available as a HTML5 export on my itch.io page: [https://nexusrexdev.itch.io/game-of-life](https://nexusrexdev.itch.io/game-of-life)
